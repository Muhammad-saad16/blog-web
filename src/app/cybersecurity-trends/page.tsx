    According to the Cyber Threat Defense Report 2022, 85% of organizations have been successfully attacked by cybercriminals.

Over the past decade, the world has rapidly shifted towards digitization, with daily utilities now accessible online through e-commerce and various services. However, this convenience has a downside, as the increasing exchange of sensitive information makes individuals, businesses, and governments vulnerable to cybercrimes during transit and storage. The interconnectedness of devices and systems further amplifies these risks, making cybersecurity a critical concern in the face of evolving cyber threats.

Cyber Security aims to protect this data from theft and damage. Therefore, cyber security has gained massive importance to protect this information. Organizations and individuals must protect their data and systems from attack.

In this article, let us look at the importance of cybersecurity. Understand cyber security, the need for cyber security, and the rising scope for cyber security professionals.
<br />
<b>What is Cyber Security?</b><br />
Cybersecurity safeguards electronic systems from threats such as information theft and damage, as individuals, companies, and governments face risks from hackers seeking unauthorized access to data centers and digital systems.

With the increasing dependence on technology for convenience, including instant information access, on-demand services, entertainment, and smart automation, Cybersecurity is crucial in securing individuals and organizations utilizing these services.

Companies use it to protect against data breaches, ransomware attacks, and financial losses, whereas individuals use it against phishing schemes, spam, identity theft, and data breaches.

Cybersecurity is an umbrella term encompassing protection against all forms of cybercrime. Organizations enlist specialized professionals such as Cyber Security Analysts, Cyber Security Consultants, Vulnerability Analysts, Penetration Testers, and Cyber Security Managers to ensure effective security and prevent cyberattacks.
<br />
<b>Global Approach to Cybersecurity </b><br />
Governments across the globe are issuing recommendations and guidelines to protect individuals and organizations from cybercrime. Leading organizations are embracing API security and increasing the security budget to hire better-skilled people to protect cyberspace. According to global data, 64% of organizations have implemented API security. Other organizations are planning to implement Zero-Trust Network Access (ZTNA), and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)

<b>Need for Cyber Security</b><br />
The importance of Cybersecurity can be seen as vital worldwide to protect against global damages. Organizations such as businesses, governments, and financial institutions are all interconnected to maintain the global economy. A severe cyber attack on any institute could damage our global economy and compromise sensitive data. Therefore, a globally collaborative cybersecurity approach is needed.

The cybersecurity global market size is anticipated to rise at a CAGR of 8.9% from USD 173.5 billion in 2022 to an estimated 266.2 billion USD by 2027. Therefore, cybersecurity is gaining momentum to ensure that important global infrastructure systems do not collapse. It is also essential for the continuity of financial institutions like banks and businesses. Hence, the importance of cybersecurity is also ever-increasing with technological advancement.

There are many reasons why cyber security is so important, like-

The cost of dealing with a cyber attack is high- A single incident can cost a company millions of dollars in damage to its reputation, lost productivity, and recovery costs.
Sensitive data can be compromised in a cyber attack- Breach of sensitive data can harm an individual. It allows criminals to commit fraud or other crimes.
Profound impact on critical infrastructure- Cyberattacks can bring down critical IT infrastructure alongside impacting power grids or financial systems.

<b>Types of Cyber Threats </b>
Common types of cyber threats are:

Cyberterrorism- Cyberterrorism is a cyber threat that is politically motivated to cause mass disruption among people and harm governments.
Malware- Malware attack includes using ransomware, spyware, viruses, and worms to attack security. Various sophisticated techniques are developed to bypass and overcome security by installing harmful viruses and encrypting data.
Trojans- Trojans are covert attacks on the system that is done by establishing a backdoor to allow access to the data. It tricks the victim into opening a harmless file and attaching itself to the system.
Botnets- Botnets are a part of the system that attacks and remotely controls the affected system. These are highly coordinated attacks done to harm large organizations.
Adware- Adware is a type of malware spread from advertising-supported software. The virus gets installed, which then bombards the victim with unwanted advertisements.
Phishing- Phishing attacks often trick the victim using email or text. They ask for personal information like bank and social security numbers. They may even trick victims into installing apps containing malware.
DoS- DoS stands for Denial of Service. It is an attack that overloads the network, making it incapable of fulfilling the victim’s request.
Types of Cybersecurity
There are many types of cybersecurity, and each offers its own unique set of benefits and features. Here are the most popular types of cybersecurity:

Critical Infrastructure Security:
Critical infrastructure security is related to critical cyber threats targeting an organization’s energy, transportation, financial services, healthcare, telecommunications, and other vital systems. These threats could potentially devastate public safety and even national security. Various nations have set protocols like the Critical Infrastructure Protection by the American government and the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection to safeguard countries against collective threats.

An instance occurred in 2013 when Iranian hackers breached New York’s Bowman Avenue Dam. They gained control of the floodgates, dams, and port systems, but little damage was reported.

Application Security:
Application security helps to prevent various malware that attacks the apps and the devices hosting them. It includes identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in application code, architecture, and configurations. It is critical to prevent access to sensitive personal information.

Amazon suffered and mitigated a major Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack in February 2020. The 2.3 Tbps (Terabits per second) DDoS attack is considered to be the largest ever.

Network Security:
Network security prevents any attack that happens over networks. It includes measures to secure network infrastructure, prevent data breaches, and protect against denial of service attacks. Most of these security systems are custom-designed to identify and block cyberattacks.


In 2017, more than 300,000 computers in 150 countries were attacked by the WannaCry ransomware attack that caused damages of billions of dollars.

Cloud Security:
Cloud security is the process of protecting cloud-based applications and data from cyber-attacks. It includes measures to secure cloud infrastructure, prevent data breaches, and protect against denial of service attacks.

A notable incident of the cloud security breach was the data scraping breach of LinkedIn in 2021. Around 700 million LinkedIn profiles were hacked, and the scraped public data was posted on a dark web forum.

Zero Trust Solutions:
The Zero Trust security model protects the organization’s data by building a single focused perimeter firewall. It also monitors threats that are target-specific and uses security to counter them. The model assumes all users are untrustworthy until proven otherwise. It includes measures to authenticate and authorize users, encrypt data and limit access to systems and data.

An untraceable large-scale ransomware attack was reported in 2021. Known as Microsoft Exchange Remote Code Execution Attack, it affected government and private organizations.

Endpoint Security:
The endpoint security model secures devices by using preventive methods to secure endpoint devices, prevent data breaches, and protect against malware. It includes the use of anti-phishing and anti-ransomware technologies. These are also beneficial to detect any anomalies if any breach takes place.
